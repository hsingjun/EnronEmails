Lessons learned

1. S3 is very slow to load/download files.
	It takes an order of magnitude longer to process to same number of files over S3 than locally.
	This is not an issue when the files are concatenated.  Thus, file i/o is the bottleneck.
2. Text processing is very fast once it's in memory.
3. Interfacing directly with AWS Streaming is error-prone.  The same techniques that generate errors when passed directly to EMR run without problem in MR Job.
